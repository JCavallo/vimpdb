TODO
====

In priority order:

- document the PDBxx commands in Ex mode.

- when switching from pdb to vimpdb, if the remote VIM is unavailable,
  log a message and keep pdb running.

- keep debugging state in vim to switch vimpdb back to pdb when closing vim.

- when resetting, close vimpdb buffer and issue message.

- key bindings in vimpdb buffer.

- try to start Vim server if it is not started.

- try to guess Vim server name to avoid need of
  ``VIMPDB_SERVERNAME``.

- check and complain if Vim does not support the right options.


and much more...
